          <p className="card-text text">
            Kanak Vrindavan Garden is a royal garden located on footsteps of
            Nahargarh hills near Amber Fort. The garden was built around 280
            years ago by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh. Its layout has been given a
            blend of Mughal and Rajput architecture. Divided into eight
            sections, the sprawling garden boasts of the intricate fountain of
            marble, Parikrama and the exquisite mirror work on the walls of
            Govind Devji temple built in the premises. The gardens here are
            often compared with those in Vrindavan where Lord Krishna once
            lived. There is also a sacred spot inside the garden where several
            rivers meet. The water in this region is considered to be holy and a
            temple was built near it to praise Lord Vishnu. <br /> <br />
            The Kanak Vrindavan Valley, located at the foot of the Nahargarh
            hills, is a picturesque garden in Jaipur. It features intricate
            ‘chhatris’, mirror and ‘jali’ work on the walls of the Govind Deoji
            temple, and a series of fountains. The garden is divided into eight
            sections, with the ‘Parikrama’ fountain, carved from a single marble
            slab, being a highlight. The ‘Garba Griha’ inside the temple complex
            is adorned with delicate ‘panni’ work. The valley offers stunning
            views of Jaipur and nearby attractions like Amer Fort and the
            Dharbawati River. Its scenic beauty has been featured in many
            Bollywood films. <br />

          <p className="card-text text">
            Located bang opposite Albert Hall Museum, the Ram Niwas Garden was
            built by Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II in 1868. Built basically as a
            famine relief project, the landscaped garden was designed by Colonel
            Sir Swinton Jacob. Spread across an area of over 30 acres, the
            garden was initially built on 76 acres of land. The addition of
            modern and increased facilities for visitors resulted in reducing
            down the garden area to a little over 30 acres. At the time when it
            was built, the number of hours and timings of entry to the garden
            was divided exclusively between the general public and royalty
            including British families. The garden was opened for common people
            during the day and evenings were meant for British families as well
            as royalty. It was mostly the families of British officers, where
            the guests, high society club members, nobles and extended families
            were entertained. The sight during evenings was something at the
            time wherein the street outside the garden used to be washed in dim
            street lights and lined by horse carriages. There were swing sets
            for children too, who could have their share of playtime.

          <p className="card-text text">
            Jaipur Development Authority restored and rewilded a sprawling set
            of dunes that had come to a standstill at the southwestern foot of
            Nahargarh. Here we brought back all the plants that one might expect
            to find here if it was truly a natural wilderness. It is called
            Kishan Bagh Sand Dune Park. The central focus of the Park is the
            natural shrubland known in Marwari as ‘Roee’, a native shrubland
            ‘jungle’ that is unrecognized and unappreciated and often treated as
            a ‘wasteland’ that needs to be rescued by feeding it water and
            encouraging agriculture. <br />
            The restoration project has been done by a team of ecological
            restoration practitioners and architects who have experience and
            familiarity with the Thar Desert. The project was a unique method of
            re-introducing not only plants but also the micro-organisms that
            play such an important part in any habitat restoration. For example,
            ‘inoculating’ a degraded habitat with soil brought from richer
            habitats, because this transfer brings not only micro-organisms and
            seeds of a large number of associated species, but also dusts the
            dunes with minerals that are essential to the new plants. <br />
