            closer to Airport, Jhalana slowly is becoming a favorite destination
            to spot leopards in wild. This otherwise shy cat is the apex
            predator here and does not have much competition for survival which
            makes them confident and therefore better sightings . Once a reserve
            forest around Jaipur, Jhalana has always been home to leopards and
            other smaller fauna including spotted deer, blue bulls, wild boars
            and loads of resident as well as migratory birds. Safari at Jhalana
            has been operational since December 2016 and as of now two safari
            routes are open for visitors. <br />
