            Jaipur is one city that transports you back to the Rajput era the
            moment you set foot there. It is dotted with architectural wonders
            and that is the reason why the city sees a good tourist footfall all
            year round. One such architectural delight right at the center of
            Jaipur is the City Palace; a symbol of the regal and royal days of
            the city. City Palace is a building that has preserved the history
            of the city and is an icon of grandeur. Once you enter the palace
            all you can do is stand transfixed by its beauty while you soak in
            the marvelous architecture and the artifacts inside the palace. City
            Palace used to be the home for the royal family of Jaipur but later
            it was divided into two parts; one which contains few courtyards and
            museums and the other where the royal family still resides.
