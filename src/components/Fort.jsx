          <p class="card-text text">
            Amer Fort, also known as Amber Fort, is a majestic fort located in
            Amer, Rajasthan, India, about 11 kilometers from Jaipur. Constructed
            in 1592 by Raja Man Singh I, it is renowned for its artistic
            Hindu-style elements combined with Mughal architecture. The fort is
            built from red sandstone and marble, and it features large ramparts,
            series of gates, and cobbled paths. It overlooks Maota Lake, which
            was the main source of water for the fort. The fort is divided into
            four main sections, each with its own courtyard. Key structures
            within the fort include the Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience),
            Diwan-e-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Sheesh Mahal (Mirror
            Palace), and Sukh Niwas, where a cool climate is artificially
            created by winds blowing over a water cascade. Amer Fort was the
            residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. It also houses
            the Shila Devi Temple, dedicated to the goddess Shila Devi, which
            was given to Raja Man Singh after his victory over the Raja of
            Jessore. The fort, along with the nearby Jaigarh Fort, is connected
            by a subterranean passage, which was used as an escape route during
            wars. In 2013, Amer Fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site
            as part of the Hill Forts of Rajasthan. It remains one of the most
            popular tourist attractions in Jaipur, drawing visitors with its
            rich history and stunning architecture. <br />
            <br />
            At Amer Fort, water collection and storage were ingeniously managed.
            Maotha Lake, an artificial reservoir, collected water from nearby
            hills via channels. The water was transported to the fort in three
            stages: <br />
            Clay Pipes: Water traveled from the lake to a large tank at the
            fort’s base, where it was desilted and aerated. <br />
            Pulleys: Water was lifted to upper tanks and smaller tanks. <br />
            Persian Wheel: Water was further lifted using a Persian wheel with
            earthenware buckets. <br /> Similarly, at Jaigarh Fort, water from
            Sagar Lake was manually carried in earthen pots up steps to a large
            tank, then lifted with pulleys and passed through canals to settle
            sand and ensure a swift flow.

            An Opulent Structure Of An Era Gone By… “Welcome to Majestic Realms
            of Nahargarh Fort, Jaipur” As an avid traveller, you must have come
            across many stories being narrated about the once majestic Nahargarh
            Fort of Jaipur. With a structure towering in Krishna Nagar, there is
            a certain effervescence that captures the mind of the wanderlust.
            Why is Nahargarh famous? What sets it apart from the other forts and
            structures of the Rajput era? <br />
            History of Nahargarh Fort Folklore and history combined to take you
            by surprise… Overlooking the gorgeous Pink City of Jaipur lies a
            magnificent structure – Nahargarh Fort. Built in 1734 by Maharaja
            Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, encompassed a larger than
            life structure that would not only protect the city but also add to
            its charm and richness. It was originally named ‘Sudarshangarh Fort’
            and was later changed to Nahargarh, which means ‘Abode of Tigers’.
            #Trivia- Nahargarh has never come under attack from any forces
            during the course of its history till date. The palace was initially
            constructed as a peaceful retreat for the king and the royal family,
            overlooking the crest of Jaipur city. #Trivia- The Fort was used as
            a place of shelter for the Europeans of the region along with the
            British Residents’ Wives to protect them during the 1857 Indian
            Mutiny or India’s War for Independence. It is located on the oldest
            mountain range of the world, Aravalli Hills, and presents an
            eclectic view of the entire city, glittering with modern lights. The
            fort underwent a renovation by the Maharaja of Jaipur in the year
            1868. <br />

            When the ruins of history come alive… <br /> A fort with bespoke
            architecture, Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur, is a mark of semblance of the
            great Rajput rulers. Literally meaning the ‘Victory Fort’, it was
            built to protect Amer Fort and its huge palace complex from enemies
            of the state. <br />
            History of Jaigarh Fort <br />
            When history speaks… <br />
            Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur was built by the ruling King Jai Singh II in
            the year 1726. With an expansive layout overlooking Amer Fort, the
            fort boasted of exuberance and royalty. It was built to be a
            defensive structure, rather than a palace itself, by the king. The
            highlight of the fort is the connecting underground pathway between
            Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort to help people reach safety, in case of
            an attack. The fort provides an excellent view of the Aravalli Range
            and Maota lake, and is actually built atop the Hill of Eagles, also
            known as Cheel ka Teela. #Trivia: It is structurally and
            architecturally quite similar to Amer Fort. It served as the
            residence of many kings and was also used to store weapons,
            artillery and ammunition of the Rajput rulers along with other
            military utilities. It was said to be the main cannon foundry for
            the Mughal rulers. The cannon outpost was protected during the many
            consecutive wars that broke out in the Mughal dynasty in 1658, until
            the protector Dara Shikoh was beaten in battle and slain by his own
            brother Aurangzeb. During the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah
            Jahan, Jaigarh Fort came to be known as the world’s most efficient
            cannon foundry. It was mainly given this title because of the
            presence of massive iron ore mines located along the vicinity of the
            fort. The wind tunnel of the cannon foundry is said to suck in the
            hot air from outside and help in melting metal to build the cannons,
            with temperatures inside soaring as high as 2400 °F. With the help
            of precision gear systems driven by four pairs of oxen, the device
            was used to hollow out the cannon barrels. The Rajputs became famous
            for their development of this device. <br /> <br />

            situated on its outside walls. These windows are also called

            perfectly shaped to allow free-flow of breeze through the palace,
            making summers seem more pleasant. The Kacchwaha Rajput ruler, Sawai
            Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai ordered his architect
            Lal Chand Ustad to construct a perfectly aligned extension to the
            Royal City Palace. Keeping in tandem with His Majesty’s wishes, this
            gorgeous ladies palace was constructed in strict adherence to Rajput
            traditions of Purdah system. <br />

          <p class="card-text text">
            Jal Mahal or the Water Palace is one of the most majestic places to
            see in Jaipur. The city is dotted with marvelous architectural
            beauties and Jal Mahal stands at the forefront of these works of
            art. Standing amidst the center of Man Sagar Lake, the palace, when
            you first look at it, will give you the illusion of almost floating
            atop the lake and that is the moment when this sight takes your
            breath away. The palace is not too high and has four dome-shaped
            pillars at four corners with a big one in the center. Jal Mahal was
            once the shooting lodging for the Maharaja of Jaipur and is now one
            of the landmarks of Jaipur. Though the city of Jaipur has earned
            itself the moniker of the pink city because of pink stone being used
            in most of its buildings, Jal Mahal is unique due to red sandstone
            used in its construction. Today, visitors cannot explore the palace
            as a tourist attraction since the place has been converted into a
            restaurant and entry to visitors has been stopped. <br />
            <br />
            The history of Jal Mahal Though there is no official record of the
            exact period of origin of Jal Mahal, legend has it that it was built
            in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, whose idea behind building
            this palace was to use it as a hunting lodge for his duck shooting
            adventures and not as a palace to stay. The origin of the lake can
            also be attributed to him as it was formed when a dam was
            constructed between the hills which led to the formation of the
            lake. Another legend says that it was built by Maharaja Madho Singh
            in the 1750s to serve as a hunting lodge. His son Madho Singh II had
            a big role to play in enhancing the interiors of Jal Mahal during
            the 18th century when he added the courtyard grounds which are still
            a part of this palace. <br />

          <p class="card-text text">
            How can memory be preserved? In our speeches or our fables? However,
            the vivid hues of recollections fade over time, and layers of dust
            eventually cover them up. But, how can our Rajas and Maharajas fail
            to preserve the grandeur of their dynasties and maintain their
            memories alive for centuries? Of course, their efforts to
            immortalize death are admirable. Death is synonymous with sadness,
            but Maharajas turned this sorrow into a 'Saga of the Past.' The most
            exquisite and graceful instance in this saga is Jaipur's famed
            'Gatore ki Chhatriyan.' <br />
            History of Gatore Ki Chhatriyan Jaipur <br /> A Rajput dynasty
            Kachwaha that reigned at Gatore Ki Chhatriyan was responsible for
            maintaining the royal crematorium grounds. Maharaja Jai Singh II,
            the founder of Jaipur, chose the site in the 18th century. Since
            1733, every Kachhwaha king has been cremated here. The only missing
            cenotaph is Maharaja Sawai Ishwari Singh, whose burial took place at
            Jaipur's city palace complex.
            <br /> <br />
            Things to Do at Gatore Ki Chhatriyan Jaipur <br />
            In Gatore, there are exquisite tombs/mausoleums of former Jaipur
            rulers. Many tourists visit this location to click mesmerizing
            pictures; hence it is one of the Instagram-worthy spots in Jaipur.
            On the other hand, many visitors come here to relax and take in the
            quiet setting of Gatore. It is worth the visit if you enjoy art,
            architecture, and history. The tranquil and peaceful ambiance is a
            nice respite from the noise of Jaipur's streets. <br /> The location
            provides a spectacular and wide-angle view of the entire city of
            Jaipur. From the Gatore, you can see significant landmarks such as
            the Jal Mahal and Mansarovar lake. Compared to other tourist
            destinations, this location is less congested and ideal for those
            seeking peace. <br />
